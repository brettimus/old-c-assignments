All of the functionality of pgmdo.c is wrapped into the readImage function.
readImage takes an input file, option, and output file.

The option arg determines whether to perform ASCII, inversion, or blurring.
It is of type integer, but often the macros ASCII, INV, or BLUR will be
used in lieu of the integer that corresponds to their function call.

All three functions take a 1-dimensional array of floats. 
Inversion and blurring both output to a .pgm file 
with the proper format (i.e., header, specs, ints).

Everything is a.o.k from the tests, however...

-- I get a warning on compilation, but it's really nonfatal.
   The compiler doesn't seem to like my switch statement in the readImage func.
-- Leaving an exit(-1) below the switch statement caused major errors but
   resolved the warning.
-- I suppose I could put some sort of error handling, but for now it didn't
   seem wholly necessary.
