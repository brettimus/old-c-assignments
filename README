Everything is working on my end.

All of the functionality of pgmdo.c is wrapped into the readImage function.
readImage takes an input file, option, and output file.

The option arg determines whether to perform ASCII, inversion, or blurring.
It is of type integer, but often the macros ASCII, INV, or BLUR will be
used in lieu of the integer that corresponds to their function call.

All three functions take a 1-dimensional array of floats. 
Inversion and blurring both output to a .pgm file 
with the proper format (i.e., header, specs, ints).

The invert function is clean, short.

Unfortunately, I took the long route for blur,
and I tacked the special cases of being a corner or
along an edge in a different way from 'center' pixels.

This resulted in about 9 different cases.
The nested conditions are labelled properly.

Everything is a.o.k from the tests, however...

-- I get a warning on compilation, but it's really nonfatal.
   The compiler doesn't seem to like my switch statement in the readImage func.
-- Leaving an exit(-1) below the switch statement caused major errors but
   resolved the warning.
-- I suppose I could put some sort of error handling, but for now it didn't
   seem wholly necessary.
